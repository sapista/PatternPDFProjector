 
PatternPDFProjector is PDF viewer designed to be used with a projector to perform an easy transfer of sewing patterns onto the fabric. This allows to directly cut the fabric without relying on paper sheets.

In contraposition to general-purpose PDF viewers, the PatternPDFProjector uses a dual screen approach. The first window allows an easy navigation through the PDF file, whereas the second windows corresponds to the image projected onto the fabric.

The image displayed on the fabric is calibrated by setting the projector DPI in a config XML file. Then, when a formally-correct PDF pattern is used, there is no need to manually adjust the zoom level to get the proper size. Patters will be the right size very time!

Moreover, PatternPDFProjector include two useful features for pattern projections that are not commonly available on PDF viewers. These are: 
* Rotation: by right-clicking on the navigation windows, the projected pattern can be rotated to any angle in order to facilitate the pattern placement onto the fabric.

* Color Inversion: a simple button to invert the colors on the projected image. This may be very convenient to improve the projected image when the color of the fabric is similar to the line color used in the PDF file.
